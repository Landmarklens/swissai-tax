## üîÑ Workflow Example

### Week 1-2: Critical Files

**Morning standup:**
- Assign 10 files from "Top 10 High-Priority Files" list
- Each developer takes 2 files

**Development:**
1. Open **I18N_QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md** for reference
2. Open assigned file in **HARDCODED_TEXT_ANALYSIS.md** to see exact lines
3. Fix using patterns from guide
4. Add translation keys to all 4 language files
5. Test with language switcher

**Code Review:**
- Use checklist from **I18N_QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md**
- Verify all patterns are fixed
- Check all 4 translation files updated

**End of week:**
- Re-run `hardcoded_text_scanner.py`
- Compare new vs. old **HARDCODED_TEXT_ANALYSIS.json**
- Update progress in **TRANSLATION_ANALYSIS_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md**
