## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Best Practices (Need to Implement)

### 1. **Multilingual Support** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Issue:** Cookie consent text is hardcoded in English with translation keys
**Impact:** GDPR requires consent in user's language
**Fix Required:**
- Add translations to de/fr/it translation files
- Cookie policy page needs translations
- All button labels must be translated

**Priority:** HIGH (Legal requirement)

---

### 2. **Cookie Management in Settings** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
**Issue:** No way for users to change preferences after initial choice
**Impact:** GDPR Article 7(3) requires easy withdrawal of consent
**Fix Required:**
- Add "Cookie Preferences" section in Settings page
- Allow users to view and modify choices anytime
- Show current consent status
- Add "Withdraw All Consent" button

**Priority:** HIGH (Legal requirement)

---

### 3. **Complete Cookie Audit** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
**Issue:** Cookie policy doesn't list ALL actual cookies
**Current listing:** Generic categories only
**Missing:**
- Exact cookie names (e.g., `_ga`, `_gat_UA-XXXXX`, `_gid`)
- Third-party cookies (GTM cookies)
- Duration details (e.g., "_ga: 2 years")
- Specific purposes for each cookie
- Who sets them (first-party vs third-party)

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Transparency requirement)

---

### 4. **Privacy Policy Integration** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Issue:** Privacy policy may not reference new cookie consent system
**Fix Required:**
- Link to cookie policy from privacy policy
- Add section about cookie consent mechanism
- Explain how users can manage preferences
- Include data controller information

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Completeness)

---

### 5. **Google Tag Manager Consent** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Issue:** GTM script loads but may not respect consent
**Current:** GTM loads unconditionally
**Fix Required:**
- Configure GTM tags to respect consent signals
- Block GTM tags until consent given
- Or use GTM consent mode integration

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Privacy protection)

---

### 6. **Cookie Banner Accessibility** üîπ LOW
**Issue:** May not meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
**Improvements Needed:**
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast verification

**Priority:** LOW (Nice to have, improves UX)

---

### 7. **Consent Proof/Logging** üîπ LOW
**Issue:** No audit trail of consent
**Best Practice:**
- Log consent timestamp (‚úÖ already done)
- Log consent version (‚úÖ already done)
- **Missing:** User ID/session ID
- **Missing:** Browser fingerprint
- **Missing:** IP address (for legal disputes)

**Priority:** LOW (Defense in case of disputes)

---

### 8. **Third-Party Service Inventory** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Issue:** No documented list of all third-party services
**Currently Using:**
- Google Analytics
- Google Tag Manager
- (Others?)

**Fix Required:**
- Document ALL third-party services
- Include in cookie policy
- Add data processing agreements references
- List data transfer mechanisms (EU/US)

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Transparency)

---

### 9. **Consent Expiration** üîπ OPTIONAL
**Current:** Consent lasts forever
**Best Practice:** Re-ask consent periodically (e.g., every 12 months)
**Implementation:**
- Add expiration date to consent object
- Show banner again after expiry
- Or prompt in settings page

**Priority:** LOW (Recommended, not required)

---

### 10. **Additional Cookie Categories** üîπ OPTIONAL
**Current Categories:**
- Essential
- Analytics
- Preferences

**Consider Adding:**
- Marketing/Advertising (if you add ads)
- Social Media (if you add social plugins)
- Security (separate from essential)

**Priority:** LOW (Only if you use these)
