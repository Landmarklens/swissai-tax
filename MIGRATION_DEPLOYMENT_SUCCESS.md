# Database Migration Deployment - SUCCESS ‚úÖ

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ‚úÖ All migrations deployed successfully to production
**Database**: swissai_tax on AWS RDS (PostgreSQL 16.6)

---

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY

Successfully deployed Stripe subscription database migrations to production database through SSH tunnel.

### Migrations Applied

1. **`20251010_add_subscription_commitment_fields.py`** ‚úÖ
   - Added 11 new columns to `swisstax.subscriptions` table
   - All columns added with idempotent checks

2. **`20251010_add_stripe_customer_id_to_users.py`** ‚úÖ
   - Added `stripe_customer_id` column to `swisstax.users` table
   - Created unique index on `stripe_customer_id`

3. **`286b9925d9d0_merge_stripe_and_incidents_branches.py`** ‚úÖ
   - Merged parallel Alembic branches (Stripe + incidents)
   - Resolved multiple head revisions

### Idempotency Verified ‚úÖ

All migrations include existence checks:
- ‚úÖ `column_exists()` checks before adding columns
- ‚úÖ `index_exists()` checks before creating indexes
- ‚úÖ `table_exists()` checks where applicable
- ‚úÖ Running `alembic upgrade head` twice causes no errors

## üîß DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### 1. SSH Tunnel Setup

```bash
ssh -i ~/Desktop/HomeAi/id_rsa -f -N -L 5433:webscraping-database.cluster-c9y2u088elix.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 ubuntu@3.221.26.92
```

**Connection Details:**
- Local Port: 5433
- RDS Host: webscraping-database.cluster-c9y2u088elix.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- RDS Port: 5432
- Database: swissai_tax
- User: webscrapinguser

### 2. Database Verification

```bash
‚úÖ Database connection successful!
PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 16.6 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
```

### 3. Migration Execution

```bash
DATABASE_HOST="localhost" \
DATABASE_PORT="5433" \
DATABASE_NAME="swissai_tax" \
DATABASE_USER="webscrapinguser" \
DATABASE_PASSWORD="IXq3IC0Uw6StMkBhb4mb" \
DATABASE_SCHEMA="swisstax" \
alembic upgrade head
```

**Output:**
```
‚úì Added column plan_commitment_years to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column commitment_start_date to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column commitment_end_date to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column trial_start to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column trial_end to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column pause_requested to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column pause_reason to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column switch_requested to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column switch_to_plan to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column cancellation_requested_at to subscriptions table
‚úì Added column cancellation_reason to subscriptions table
‚úì Added stripe_customer_id column to users table
‚úì Created unique index on stripe_customer_id
```

### 4. Alembic State

**Before:**
```
20251010_incidents (branch 1)
20251010_stripe_customer (branch 2)
```

**After:**
```
286b9925d9d0 (head) (mergepoint)
```

## üêõ ISSUES ENCOUNTERED & RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Multiple Head Revisions

**Error:**
```
Multiple head revisions are present for given argument 'head'
```

**Root Cause:**
- Two parallel migration branches from `20251010_sessions`:
  - Branch 1: sessions ‚Üí subscription ‚Üí stripe_customer
  - Branch 2: sessions ‚Üí incidents

**Solution:**
1. Created merge migration: `alembic merge`
2. Resolved duplicate entries in `alembic_version` table
3. Successfully upgraded to merged head

### Issue 2: Duplicate alembic_version Entries

**Error:**
```
Requested revision 20251010_incidents overlaps with other requested revisions 20251010_sessions
```

**Root Cause:**
- Both `20251010_sessions` and `20251010_incidents` were present in `alembic_version` table
- Caused conflict when trying to upgrade

**Solution:**
```python
# Removed duplicate entry
DELETE FROM alembic_version WHERE version_num = '20251010_sessions';
```

- ‚úÖ Trial periods (30 days default)

### 2. Configure AWS Parameter Store (Manual - REQUIRED)

Add the following parameters in AWS Systems Manager ‚Üí Parameter Store:

# Stripe API Keys (from Stripe Dashboard)
/swissai-tax/stripe/secret-key           = sk_live_... (SecureString)
/swissai-tax/stripe/publishable-key      = pk_live_... (String)
/swissai-tax/stripe/webhook-secret       = whsec_... (SecureString)

/swissai-tax/stripe/price-annual-flex    = price_... (String)
/swissai-tax/stripe/price-5-year-lock    = price_... (String)

# Feature Flag (initially false, enable when ready)
/swissai-tax/features/enable-subscriptions = false (String)
```

### 3. Deploy Backend Code (READY)

The backend code is already deployed with the latest commit:
```
1f34db4 - chore: Add merge migration for stripe and incidents branches
25eb4be - feat: Complete Stripe subscription implementation with tests and bug fixes
```

### 4. Enable Feature Flag (After Testing)

Once Stripe is configured and tested in staging:

```bash
# Update Parameter Store
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "/swissai-tax/features/enable-subscriptions" \
  --value "true" \
  --type "String" \
  --overwrite

# Restart backend to load new config (or it will load on next request)
```

### 5. Test Subscription Flow

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Create new user account
- [ ] Select Annual Flex plan
- [ ] Complete SetupIntent with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Verify 30-day trial starts
- [ ] Check subscription appears in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Verify webhook events are received
- [ ] Test cancellation during trial (should work immediately)
- [ ] Test cancellation after trial (should cancel at period end)
- [ ] Switch plans during trial
- [ ] Verify billing history shows invoices

### 6. Frontend Deployment

**Frontend changes are already pushed:**
- Updated `src/services/subscriptionService.js`
- All API endpoints configured
- Stripe Elements integration ready

Deploy frontend with environment variables:
```bash
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
```
