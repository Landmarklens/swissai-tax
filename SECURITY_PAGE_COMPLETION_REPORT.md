### Translations needed for:
- ✅ English (provided above)
- ⏳ German (DE)
- ⏳ French (FR)
- ⏳ Italian (IT)

**Note**: Due to the extensive nature of translations, I recommend using a professional translation service for German, French, and Italian. The English version above can be used as the master copy for translation.

---

## Routing Updates Required

### File: `src/constants/lazyRoutes.js`

**Add this import** at the top with other lazy imports:
```javascript
const Security = withSuspense(lazy(() => import('../pages/Security/Security')));
```

**Add this route** to `LAZY_NAVIGATION_ROUTE` array (after line 233):
```javascript
// Security page
{ path: '/security', element: <Security /> },
```

---

## Navigation Updates

### File: `src/components/footer/Footer.jsx` (if exists)

Add a link to the security page in the footer navigation:
```jsx
<Link to="/security">Security</Link>
```

---

## SEO Enhancements (Optional)

The page already includes:
- ✅ Meta title and description via `SEOHelmet`
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure (h1, h2, h3)
- ✅ Descriptive text content
- ✅ Responsive design

**Optional additions**:
```html
<!-- In the <head> section, you could add: -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Security & Data Protection",
  "description": "SwissAI Tax security features and data protection practices",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
