# Interview Questions - Changes Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Enables all tax calculations

---

## 🎯 Objective

Fix critical missing questions and restructure interview flow to enable accurate Swiss tax calculations.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Q00b - Date of Birth**
**Location:** After Q00 (AHV number), before Q01 (civil status)
**Type:** `date`
**Required:** Yes
**Category:** `personal_info`

**Why Critical:**
- Social security calculations require age
- AHV/IV rates vary by age (especially age 25 threshold)
- Previously defaulted to age 35, causing inaccurate calculations

**Flow:**
```
Q00 (AHV) → Q00b (Date of Birth) → Q01 (Civil Status)
```

---

### 2. **Q01b - Residence Postal Code** ⚠️ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Location:** After Q01a (spouse AHV) for married, after Q01 for others
**Type:** `postal_code` with `auto_lookup: true`
**Required:** Yes
**Category:** `personal_info`

**Why Critical:**
- **BLOCKS ALL TAX CALCULATIONS** without this
- Determines canton and municipality for:
  - Cantonal tax rates
  - Municipal tax multipliers
  - Church tax rates
  - Wealth tax thresholds

**Flow:**
```
Single/Divorced/Widowed: Q01 (Civil Status) → Q01b (Postal Code) → Q03 (Children)
Married: Q01 → Q01a_name → Q01a (Spouse AHV) → Q01b (Postal Code) → Q03 (Children)
```

---

### 3. **Q04b_amount - Employment Income Amount**
**Location:** After Q04b (Lohnausweis upload)
**Type:** `currency`
**Required:** Yes
**Category:** `income_sources`
**Max:** CHF 10,000,000

**Why Critical:**
- Q04 asked number of employers but not the income amount
- Tax service expects `income_employment` from answers
- Enables immediate tax estimate (AI extraction happens later)

**Flow:**
```
Q04b (Upload Lohnausweis) → Q04b_amount (Enter Amount) → Q04c (Professional Expenses)
```

---

### 4. **Q08_amount - Pillar 3a Contribution Amount**
**Location:** After Q08 (yes/no for Pillar 3a)
**Type:** `currency`
**Required:** Yes (if Q08 = yes)
**Category:** `deductions`
**Max:** CHF 7,056 (2024 limit)

**Why Critical:**
- Major tax deduction (CHF 7,056 max)
- Can save CHF 1,400-2,800 in taxes
- Previously only asked yes/no, not amount

**Flow:**
```
Q08 (Have Pillar 3a?) → Q08_amount (How much?) → Q14 (Pension Income)
```

---

### 5. **Q14_amount - Pension Income Amount**
**Location:** After Q14 (yes/no for pension income)
**Type:** `currency`
**Required:** Yes (if Q14 = yes)
**Category:** `income_sources`

**Why Critical:**
- Pension income taxed at preferential rates (30-60% lower)
- Tax service expects `pension_income` amount
- Previously only asked yes/no

**Flow:**
```
Q14 (Receive Pension?) → Q14_amount (Pension Amount) → Q09 (Real Estate)
```

---

### 6. **Q18_wealth_total - Total Net Wealth**
**Location:** After Q18_bank_statements
**Type:** `currency`
**Required:** Yes
**Category:** `property_assets`

**Why Critical:**
- Wealth tax cannot be calculated without net wealth amount
- Q18_bank_statements uploaded documents but didn't ask for total
- Enables immediate wealth tax estimate

**Flow:**
```
Q18_bank_statements (Upload) → Q18_wealth_total (Enter Total) → Q10 (Securities)
```

---

### 7. **Q15_amount - Foreign Income Amount**
**Location:** Added field to Q15_details group
**Type:** `currency`
**Required:** Yes (if foreign income exists)
**Category:** `income_sources`

**Why Critical:**
- Switzerland taxes worldwide income
- Tax service expects `foreign_income` amount
- Previously only collected country/type, not amount

---

### 8. **Work Percentage Field**
**Location:** In Q04a_employer group
**Type:** `number` (already existed, enhanced help text)
**Category:** `income_sources`

**Enhancement:**
- Added clearer help text explaining 100 = full-time, 80 = 80%, etc.
- Social security calculator needs this for accurate contribution calculations

---

## 🔄 Flow Restructuring

### Church Membership Questions Moved ✅

**Previous Flow:**
```
Q03 (Children) → Q02a (Other Cantons) → ... → Q17 (Church - in special_situations)
```

**New Flow:**
```
Q03 (Children) → Q03a (Number) → Q03c (Childcare) → Q17 (Church Member?) → Q17a (Which Church?) → Q02a (Other Cantons)
```

**Why:**
- Church tax applies to 70%+ of taxpayers (22/26 cantons)
- It's a standard tax, not a "special situation"
- Better UX to ask early with personal info

---

### Other Cantons Flow Fixed ✅

**Previous Issue:**
- Asked about "other cantons" before knowing primary canton

**Fix:**
- Q02a/Q02b now come after residence canton question (Q01b)
- Logical: "Your residence is canton X, do you have income in OTHER cantons?"

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- ❌ Inaccurate social security (missing age)
