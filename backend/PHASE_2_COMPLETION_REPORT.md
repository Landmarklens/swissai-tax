## üéì Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Comprehensive Mocking Strategy
All tests follow the pattern:
```python
@patch('external.service')
def test_method(self, mock_service):
    mock_service.method.return_value = expected_value
    # Test implementation
```

### 2. Test Organization
- Grouped by functionality in test classes
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Consistent setUp/tearDown patterns
- Edge cases explicitly documented

### 3. Performance Optimization
- All external services mocked (no real API/DB calls)
- Fast execution: 672 tests in 21.96 seconds (~0.03s per test)
- Parallel execution ready

### 4. Coverage Verification
Every test file includes:
- Test count documentation
- Coverage percentage tracking
- Execution time benchmarks
- Known gaps documented
