"""Add missing foreign keys for User.sessions, DocumentType.documents, and other relationships

Revision ID: f7a413dd9ee4
Revises: multi_filing_support
Create Date: 2025-10-07 14:28:11.477529

NOTE: This migration is empty because all FKs already exist in the database.
The relationship errors are due to model definitions not matching the database schema.
We're leaving this migration empty and will fix models to match DB instead.
