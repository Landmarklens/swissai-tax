## Federal Tax System Overview

### What is Federal Tax?

Swiss federal tax is **one of three tax levels** in Switzerland:
1. **Federal Tax** (covered in this document)
2. **Canton Tax** (see Canton Tax Calculators documentation)
3. **Municipal Tax** (applied via canton tax)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Progressive system:** Tax rate increases with income
- **Marginal rates:** Different rates for income brackets
- **Marital status sensitive:** Separate brackets for single vs married
- **Child deductions:** CHF 6,600 per child
- **Relatively low:** 0% - 11.5% maximum rate

### 2024 Federal Tax Rates

**Rate Range:**
- **Minimum:** 0% (tax-free threshold)
- **Maximum:** 11.5% (top marginal rate)
- **Most common:** 2% - 8% for middle-income earners

**Compared to Cantons:**
Federal tax typically represents **20-30% of total tax burden**. Canton and municipal taxes are usually higher.

## Deductions (Federal Level)

### Standard Deductions

#### 1. **Professional Expenses Deduction**

**For Employed Persons:**
- **Standard:** 3% of gross employment income
- **Minimum:** CHF 2,000
- **Maximum:** CHF 4,000

**Example:**
```
Gross salary: CHF 100,000
3% = CHF 3,000
→ Deduction: CHF 3,000 (within min/max range)

Gross salary: CHF 50,000
3% = CHF 1,500
→ Deduction: CHF 2,000 (minimum applies)

Gross salary: CHF 200,000
3% = CHF 6,000
→ Deduction: CHF 4,000 (maximum applies)
```

**For Self-Employed:**
- Actual business expenses (documented)
- No standard 3% deduction
- Must provide receipts/documentation

#### 2. **Pillar 3a Contributions (Private Pension)**

**For Self-Employed without Pension Fund:**
- **Maximum:** CHF 35,280 per year (2024)
- **Fully deductible** from taxable income
- Up to 20% of net income

```

#### 3. **Health Insurance Premiums**

**Standard Deduction (if not documented):**
- **Single:** CHF 1,750 per year
- **Married:** CHF 3,500 per year

**Actual Premiums (if documented):**
- Can deduct actual basic health insurance premiums
- Supplementary insurance usually not deductible (canton-dependent)

**Example:**
```
Single person pays CHF 3,600/year basic insurance
→ Can deduct CHF 3,600 (better than CHF 1,750 standard)

Married couple pays CHF 7,200/year combined
→ Can deduct CHF 7,200 (better than CHF 3,500 standard)
```

#### 4. **Child Deductions**

**Amount:** CHF 6,600 per child (2024)

**Eligibility:**
- Dependent children under 18
- Children 18+ in education/training

**Example:**
```

Tax savings: ~CHF 1,500-3,500 depending on rate
```

#### 5. **BVG/Pillar 2 Employee Contributions**

**Amount:** Actual BVG employee contributions

**Typical Amounts (age-dependent):**
- Age 25-34: ~7% of coordinated salary
- Age 35-44: ~10% of coordinated salary

- Age 55-65: ~18% of coordinated salary

**Example:**
```

Coordinated salary: 85,000 - 25,725 = CHF 59,275
BVG contribution (10%): CHF 5,928
→ Fully deductible from taxable income
```

#### 6. **Alimony Payments**

**Deductible:**
- Alimony to former spouse
- Child support (in some cases)

**Requirements:**
- Court-ordered or official agreement

───────────────────────────
Taxable income:  CHF 67,266
```

**Step 3: Apply Federal Tax Brackets (Single)**
```
CHF 0 - 17,800:      0% = CHF 0

```

**Step 3: Apply Federal Tax Brackets (Married)**
```
CHF 0 - 29,400:        0% = CHF 0
CHF 29,400 - 50,900:   1% = CHF 215
CHF 50,900 - 58,400:   2% = CHF 150
CHF 58,400 - 75,300:   3% = CHF 507
CHF 75,300 - 90,300:   4% = CHF 600
CHF 90,300 - 103,400:  5% = CHF 655
CHF 103,400 - 114,700: 6% = CHF 678
CHF 114,700 - 124,200: 7% = CHF 665
CHF 124,200 - 130,988: 8% = CHF 543

───────────────────────────
Taxable income:  CHF 74,250
```

**Step 3: Apply Federal Tax Brackets (Single)**
```
CHF 0 - 17,800:      0% = CHF 0
CHF 17,800 - 31,600: 0.77% = CHF 106

## Special Cases

### Income Splitting for Married Couples

**How it works:**
- Married couples can file jointly
- Income is combined
- Taxed using married brackets (more favorable)

**Benefit:**
When one spouse earns significantly more than the other, joint filing usually results in lower total tax.

**Example:**
```
Spouse A earns: CHF 120,000
Spouse B earns: CHF 30,000
Total: CHF 150,000

Option 1: Separate (if allowed)
  A's tax: ~CHF 8,500
  B's tax: ~CHF 150
  Total: ~CHF 8,650

Option 2: Joint (married brackets)
  Combined tax: ~CHF 3,200

Savings: ~CHF 5,450 per year
```

### Pension Recipients

**Special Treatment:**
- Pension income taxed separately at reduced rates
- Lump-sum pension payouts: Special one-time tax
- AHV/IV pensions: Lower taxation

### Part-Year Residents

**Proration:**
- Tax calculated on annual basis
- Prorated based on days in Switzerland
- Canton-specific rules may apply

### Foreign Income

**Taxation:**
- Switzerland taxes worldwide income for residents
- Double taxation agreements prevent duplicate taxation
- Foreign tax credits may apply
